title: 'Make densification obsolete'
date: 2025-08-10
deadline: 2025-09-07
summary: 'This bounty aims to improve training quality without using densification by providing a stronger initialization.'
winner: ''
---
The quality of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) depends strongly on the initial point cloud. This bounty aims to improve training quality **without** using densification by providing a stronger initialization. Ideally, this transfers to the training with densification.

**Goal:** Provide a method to initialize training with a better point cloud that improves final quality.
**Bonus:** Match or beat the **densified** baseline metrics using only your improved initialization.

---

## üîß Rules

* **No densification.** Use the [MipNeRF360 dataset](http://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/refraw360/360_v2.zip) and the original poses. The reference metrics below were generated **with densification disabled** for **30k** steps using `./scripts/bounty_002_disabled_densification.sh`.
  Your solution must reach **mean PSNR ‚â• 28.0** without densification after 30k steps to qualify.

* Ideally, the solution is directly mergeable into the repo. A Python-only solution is allowed if it uses deep learning or Python-only deps.

* Third-party code must be GPLv3-compatible. Allowed: MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD. Not allowed: DUSt3R, MAST3R, VGGT (including commercial licenses).

* Your contribution must be licensed as **GPLv3**.

* Running `scripts/bounty_002_full_eval` on standard benchmarks may not degrade metrics. The initialization should ideally improve them. An undisclosed dataset will be used to check for overfitting or dataset bias. The reference results are included here:

* Random initialization does not qualify. Reusing a 3DGS trained model (a ***final splat***) or **intermediate** checkpoints of the 3DGS pipeline as initial point cloud is not allowed. Build a genuine initialization and don't try to fake it.

* The method must run on consumer hardware with **‚â§ 24 GB VRAM**. It must scale to large datasets with no hard cap on the number of images. **2k‚Äì3k images** or larger datasets must work. Preprocessing time must be **‚â§ 50%** of a scene‚Äôs full training time. Example: if full training with densification takes 8 minutes, your preprocessing may take at most 4 minutes.

* Avoid massive floaters. Visual results will be inspected.

* Your pull request must include a concise summary of your approach.

* Collaboration is welcome. You may work individually or form teams. Join the [MrNeRF & Brush Discord](https://discord.gg/NqwTqVYVmj) to discuss ideas, share progress, and connect with other participants.

**Bonus goal: additional \$500** 
1. Match or exceed the **densified** baseline metrics from `scripts/bounty_002_full_eval` **without** using densification. Optimize only the **initial point cloud**. You can run the same script with `--disable-densification` to verify.

or 

2. Demonstrate that your method significantly reduces floaters.

## Notes

* If your method needs new dependencies, justify them and keep setup simple.
* Reproducibility matters. Please fix seeds where applicable and document data preprocessing.
* Rules can be adjusted if necessary.
