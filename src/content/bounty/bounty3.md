title: 'Automatic Per-Scene Hyperparameter Optimization'
date: 2025-09-14
deadline: 2025-10-12
summary: 'Build a system that automatically finds optimal hyperparameters for each scene.'
winner: ''
---
**Build a system that automatically finds optimal hyperparameters for each scene.**

**Challenge.** Different scenes need different hyperparameters. Create an automatic optimization system (RL-based or other approaches) that discovers the best settings *per scene* during training without manual tuning and scales to new scenes.

## üßæ Rules

1. **Fork from** the `bounty_004` branch.
2. **Automatic per-scene optimization** must run during training (no manual per-scene tuning).  Your solution should be able to tune parameters such as:

   * Learning rates (e.g., position, scale, rotation, opacity, SH)
   * Densification thresholds and intervals
   * **Number of iterations** (treated as a hyperparameter)
   * **Number of Gaussians** (see densification below)
   * Any other parameters that affect quality or convergence

   => For instance, changing only the number of iterations as main driver does not qualify! It should be clear that the system tries to figure out an optimal configuration over a none trivial subset of parameters. 

3. **Densification strategy: MCMC.** The approach must use **MCMC-based densification**; the **number of Gaussians is a tunable hyperparameter.**
4. **Target improvement:** Achieve an average **+0.15 dB PSNR** improvement *over baseline* on the MipNeRF360 dataset (and further scenes). See benchmarks below.

## Quality Metrics Summary

| Scene    | Iteration | PSNR    | SSIM     | LPIPS    | Num Gaussians |

| **mean** | **30000** | **29.4278** | **0.887709** | **0.203954** | **2,800,657** |

5. **Dataset:** Use the official MipNeRF360 dataset: üì¶ `360_v2.zip` ‚Üí [http://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/refraw360/360_v2.zip](http://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/refraw360/360_v2.zip)
6. **Generalization test:** Your method **will be evaluated on one or two undisclosed scenes** in addition to MipNeRF360. Approaches must **scale beyond MipNeRF360** without scene-specific hacks.
7. **Licensing:** You may only use **GPLv3-compatible dependencies** (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, GPLv3, etc.). List all third-party deps in your README with licenses.
8. **Implementation language:**

   * **Preferred:** C++ implementation committed to `bounty_004` branch.
   * **Alternative:** Python implementations are accepted, **but total award is reduced by 20%.**

9. **Reproducibility:** Provide a single command (or script) to reproduce your results per scene, including fixed seeds where relevant.

> **Important:** Results are **not only measured via PSNR** - they will also be **visually inspected** for artifacts (ghosting, floaters, oversmoothing, texture shimmering, etc.).
