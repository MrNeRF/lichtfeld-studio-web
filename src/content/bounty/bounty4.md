As the bonus challenge in bounty #284 was not cleared, I am offering a $500 payout for someone who can take both approaches, combine them, and clearly demonstrate an improvement over each approach in isolation. There is no deadline.

Please create a pull request, describe what you did, and ensure that I can run the scripts without much hassle (i.e., no missing dependencies, broken code, or incomplete scripts).
